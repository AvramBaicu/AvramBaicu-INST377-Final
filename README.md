Project Description:<br>
     Minority demographics is a website that allows users to get a general location of a minority within a state. This can help others create events for them making it a more welcoming environment. There could be sporting events for those with a high population of the teams, there could be festivals developed for the city, Holidays and more. This could help those who feel like they are not welcomed find a community within their culture.
